## Custom Device XML Editor ##

The **Custom Device XML Editor** is a tool that is meant to simplify configuration of custom devices by giving you a better, simpler interface and automatically exposing the user to all configuration options without needing to know the possible XML tags.

### Source is Not Public ###

This tool is still very much in dev and is just a side project. Once it gets to a stable spot, I'll move it to our GIT repo since there's no reason long term for this tool/source to remain internal.

### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2015 & VeriStand 2015

### Built Availability ###

EXE builds aren't checked into the repo but the build spec exists in the project so just build it and you'll have an exe.

### Quality, Limitations ###

This is 100% still in dev. So download and run at your own risk. I'll be committing code often so the stack may be stable one day and completely destroy your XML file the next. So again, user beware; reach out to me if you really need to know where the current stack stands quality wise.

### Dependencies ###
